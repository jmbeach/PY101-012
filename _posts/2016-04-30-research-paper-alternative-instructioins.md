title: Research Paper Alternative Instructioins
---

The following is a guide to signing up and getting started on the research 
paper alternative for those who were not able to get all twelve study credits.

## Instructions from the research pool website
<blockquote>
This is the alternative option for students that would prefer to write papers rather than participate in experiments. Below is a link that will lead you to a page. Select Research Papers to download a zip file. Inside that file there are 12 articles. Choose ONE article for EACH credit that you need to complete. SO if you need 6 credits select 6 articles. Review the article and write a 600-word paper. The first page should be a summary of the article and the second should be your opinions and thoughts on the research. The papers should be typed in Times new Roman 12 and double spaced. Papers that are not 600 words will not be counted. Once you complete your papers, send them as Microsoft Word email attachments to: subjpool@bama.ua.edu Before sending your papers, make sure they can be opened. It is your responsibility to ensure the attached files are not corrupt and can be opened in Microsoft Word. If they cannot be opened, you will not receive credit. The deadline for this is April 29th.

## Step by step

1. Go to [the research paper website](http://psychology.ua.edu/subject-pool-papers/)
2. For each credit you're missing, choose an article from the website and write a 600 word paper on it
3. After completing each paper, send the paper to the following e-mail address as a word document attachment: subjpool@bama.ua.edu
    + The credit should be awarded after it is reviewed

+ Sadly, it says that the deadline is April 29th, but maybe it will be extended
