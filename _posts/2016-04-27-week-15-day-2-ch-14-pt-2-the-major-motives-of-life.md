## The Motives of Life
+ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/motives.png)

## Why Do We Love
+ Audio 0:02:03.564036 
+ 
### Biology of love
+ Neurological origins of passionate love begin in infancy, when infants attach to the mother
+ Hormones involved in pleasure and reward are activated in the mother–baby bond and in the pair bond of adult lovers
    + Vasopressin, oxytocin
    + Increasing these oxytocin leads to:
        + Greater trust in risky situations
        + Audio 0:02:55.228834 
        + Greater affection (e.g., gazing, touching) among romantic couples
        + But also: Increased favoritism toward ingroup, aggression toward outgroup; increased distrust among anxiously-attached people
            + Audio 0:05:06.695517 

### Influence of endorphins
+ Audio 0:07:29.280713 
+ Recall: brain’s natural opiates
+ Maternal comfort in humans and nonhuman animals increases endorphins
    + Euphoria of endorphins may be initial motivation for affection
    + "We are addicted to love"
+ Similar neural responses occur in adult relationships
    + Exhilaration of new love, physical and emotional distress of separation
        + Audio 0:08:07.336444 
        + Feel like you have to be with that person
        + You can look at classic writing and people will describe longing when separated from a partner
+ fMRIs have shown other neurological similarities between different types of love
    + Audio 0:09:16.885717 
    + Certain parts of the brain activate when people look at pictures of their sweethearts and biological children

## How Do We Form Relationships
+ Two types of love and relationships:
+ *Passionate (romantic) love*
    + Love characterized by a whirlwind of intense emotions and sexual desire
+ *Companionate love*
    + Love characterized by affection and trust
    + In most enduring relationships, passionate love evolves into companionate love

## What is Love?
+ Audio 0:12:33.850033 
+ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/whatislove.png)
+ Audio 0:13:52.599838 
    + Passion is more short-lived
    + Research shows that passion and intimacy have a somewhat inverse relationship
        + As one increases the other usually decreases 

## How do we form relationships
+ Major factors influencing our relationships
    + Audio 0:15:42.662116 
    + *Proximity*: we tend to choose our friends and lovers from a set of people who live, study, or work near us
    + *Similarity*: our friends and lovers tend to be similar to us in looks, attitudes, beliefs, values, personality, and interests
        + “Opposites attract” vs. “bird of a feather”
        + [Matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxoWUL0eqg4) [principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB1oMfs8nWY): the most successful romantic couples also tend to be the most physically similar
            + Audio 0:18:34.111026 
            + Kind of bleak?
                + Audio 0:23:28.590009 
        + Is this always true? When might it not work out this way?
            + Assumes that we are completely rational about finding the most attractive person

## What do you think?
+ Soul mates vs. proximity?
+ “Opposites attract” vs. “birds of a feather”?
+ Discuss with your neighbor
    + Audio 0:27:30.560891 

## Attachment theory of love
+ Audio 0:34:17.882358 
+ Like infants to their caregivers, adults have attachment styles to their partners
    + Idea is that the style carries over from childhood
    + Secure: rarely jealous or worried about abandonment
    + Anxious: agitated and worried partner will leave; clingy
        + Audio 0:36:04.331544 
            + Need reassurance
        + Physiological component – cortisol spikes when they feel the relationship is threatened
            + People with this attachment style have greater physiological responses 
                + Say the partner makes a new friend of the opposite sex, that would cause the avoidant partner's heart-rate to increase
    + Avoidant: distrustful; avoids intimate attachments
+ *A person’s style of dealing with romantic partners seems to be based on how they were treated by their parents*
    + Children form internal “working models” for what relationships should be like (e.g., “Can I trust others?”)  adult relationships
    + How your parents treat you seems to determine how you attach to relationships in your adult life
        + However, it is just pre-disposition, it is not certain you will have this attachment style

## Identify attachment
+ Audio 0:39:43.233114 
+ “I find it difficult to trust people completely. I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others. I feel nervous when people start to get too close. Often, I feel like people want me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable being. I find it difficult to allow myself to depend on other people.”
+ Which attachment style does this describe?
    + a. Anxious
    + b. Secure
    + c. Avoidant
        + C

## Identify attachment
+ “I find it relatively easy to get close to other people. I am comfortable depending on other people and having them depend on me. I don’t usually worry about being abandoned or about having someone get too close to me.”
Which attachment style does this describe?
    + a. Anxious
    + b. Secure
    + c. Avoidant
        + B

## What Sustains Love?
+ Romantic love fades, yes; but not for everyone
    + Can persist for many years for some couples
    + But, loses the obsessive component that fosters constant thought and worry
+ Perception by both partners that the relationship is fair, rewarding, and balanced
    + Too many or too little benefits cause guilt or resentment, respectively
+ Motivation: why does each partner want to maintain the relationship?
    + Positive: to enjoy affection and intimacy  sustainable
    + Negative: to avoid feeling insecure and lonely  unsustainable
    + Audio 0:43:29.064671 

### Dealing with conflict
+ The way a couple deals with conflict often determines whether the relationship will last
+ *Gottman (1994) describes four interpersonal styles that typically lead couples to discord and dissolution*:
    + Being overly critical
    + Holding the partner in contempt
    + Being defensive
    + Mentally withdrawing from the relationship
+ Attributional style also plays a role
    + Good outcomes -> situation
    + Bad outcomes -> each other
        + Assigning the outcome of an event to be the partner's fault
