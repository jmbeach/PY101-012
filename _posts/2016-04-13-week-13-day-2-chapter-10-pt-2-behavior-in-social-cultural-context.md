		+ Watching video

## What does this tell us about roles?
+ Audio 0:08:03.815588 
	+ Roles are everywhere and they are powerful
	+ They cause us to behave differently
+ Criticisms of the study
	+ Selective sampling
		+ Some belief that some of the people who wanted to be in the study were kind of biased to want power
+ Lack of replicability
	+ Huge violation of participant rights
	+ Made a significant impact on the field in terms of what is okay to do
+ Instructions may have encouraged the observed behavior
	+ Zambardo might have encouraged them to be agressive
+ Could this also be viewed as a study about obedience to authority?
	+ If so, in what way?
		+ Audio 0:11:49.064318 
	+ In studies, there is an implicit desire to please the experimenter
		+ Audio 0:15:08.827373 
			+ Maybe the prisoners felt they needed to finish the experiment

## What's driving these behaviors

### Social cognition

Audio 0:25:50.754674 

+ An area of social psychology concerned with social influences on thought, memory, perception, and beliefs

### Attributions
+ Our causal explanations for other people’s behavior
+ “Joe did what?! Why?????”
+ Logical (not covered here) and illogical attributions
	+ Audio 0:27:56.242063 
		+ Assume people are making rational judgements of their environment
		+ Thinking about all the available options and picking the one that makes the most sense
			+ This doesn't match reality
+ Attribution theory suggests that people are motivated to find situational or dispositional causes for their own and other people’s behaviors
	+ Audio 0:29:31.190519 
		+ Person + Environment = Behavior

+ Situational attribution
	+ ![](http://snag.gy/U2Cl9.jpg)
		+ Aladin
			+ Audio 0:30:09.597260 
			+ He's poor
				+ That's why he steals bread
+ Dispositional attribution
	+ ![](http://snag.gy/Mu5z1.jpg)
		+ Aladin
			+ He steals becauase he's a theif

### What determines the nature of our attribution (dispositional vs. situational)?
+ Usually, the target of the attribution
	+ Dave Chappelle on attributions: 
		+ Audio 0:32:31.083686 
		+ [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdim8hWR44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLdim8hWR44)
	+ Louis CK: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xquhBIlDIpM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xquhBIlDIpM)
+ What is Dave getting at?
	+ Audio 0:35:10.221291 
	+ The situational look at Oscar is he's a grouch because he lives in a trash can
	+ The dispositional look is that he's a grouch by nature
+ Fundamental attribution error (FAE)
	+ The tendency to overestimate personality factors and underestimate the influence of the situation when drawing conclusions about the behavior of other people
	+ Audio 0:36:11.649640 
		+ Think about someone with chronic pain
		+ They might be upset or irritable often
			+ You might make an FAE and say that that's part of their personality

### What causes the FAE?
+ Audio 0:37:17.998503 
+ Situations lack salience and go unnoticed
	+ When you see someone doing something, you don't care about what they were doing 4 minutes before
		+ If someone cuts you off in traffic, do you think "Oh I bet his wife is in labor and he's going to see her in the hospital"
			+ You probably think "f*** you!"
	+ Availability heuristic
+ Underestimating the impact of the situation
	+ Classic experiments from last lecture
+ Impact of situation may be salient initially, but then fade over time
	+ Audio 0:39:08.193296 
		+ You might forget that your friend Kathy has a chronic pain disorder
+ Belief that the person caused the situation
	+ Kathy is a bad person who does bad things
		+ Therefore she causes her own pain
		+ Or: Therefore she deserves her pain

### What determines the nature of our attribution (dispositional vs. situational)?

+ Audio 0:41:29.745766 
+ Usually, the target of the attribution (others  FAE)
+ Self-serving biases
	+ Audio 0:42:39.612463 
	+ Tendency to attribute our successes to dispositional factors and our failures to situational factors
	+ ![](http://snag.gy/cGtoz.jpg)

### Self-Serving Biases

1. Choosing the most flattering and forgiving attributions for our behavior
	+ “I’m not sexist; the male job candidate’s credentials were honestly just better.”
	+ “Well, I didn’t hire her because I honestly think a man would do the job better.”
2. The “better than average” effect
	+ The tendency to believe that we are better, smarter, and kinder than others
	+ Example 
		+ 70% of high school students said they were above the median for leadership skills
			+ Everyone is inclined to think they are above average
		+ 85% for getting along well with others
+ When the average person is exposed to the suffering of an innocent person, how do you think they will respond?
	+ What is a normative response?
		+ Audio 0:45:55.005819 
		+ Feel bad for them
	+ Do normative responses always occur?
		+ No, usually people try to find a way that the person caused their pain
3. The bias to believe that the world is fair
	+ Good people are rewarded and bad people are punished
		+ Karma essentially
	+ The just-world hypothesis
	+ “You reap what so you sow”, “They deserve what’s coming to them”
	+ Rooted in the need to predict one’s environment and make long-term goals
	+ Motivated responses  victim blaming and victim derogation
