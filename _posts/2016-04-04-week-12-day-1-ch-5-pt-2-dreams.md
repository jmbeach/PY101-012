# Dreams

+ Two categories:
	+ Non-REM dreams: shorter, relatively dull (e.g., what sweater should I wear?) 
	+ REM dreams: More likely to be bizarre and include intense emotions, visual and auditory hallucinations, and uncritical acceptance of illogical events 
+ Explanation: 
	+ Non-REM: General de-activation of many brain regions
	+ REM: Brain structures associated with motivation, emotion, reward, vision are active; pre-frontal cortex is not 

## Lucid Dreams

Audio 0:05:00

+ Dreams in which the dreamer is aware of dreaming
	+ In some cases, the dreamer may be able to control the action in their dreams, much like a scriptwriter in a movie
+ Dr. Berit Brogaard 
	+ Knowing that you are dreaming
	+ Being able to control your own dream actions in a wake-like fashion
	+ Being able to manipulate your dream surroundings
	+ Being able to manipulate the dream actions of other people in your dreams

## Meaning
+ Psychoanalytic theory (Freud): Dreams contain hidden content that represents unconscious conflicts
	+ Manifest content: The plot of a dream; the way the dream is remembered
		+ Audio 0:09:17
	+ Latent content: What a dream symbolizes; the material that is disguised in a dream to protect the dreams from confronting direct reality
	+ No scientific evidence that dreams represent hidden conflicts or for the special symbolic meaning of dream images

## Problem-Focused Theory
+ Question: 
	+ Why do people often dream about threatening events? 
+ Answer: 
	+ Audio 0:13:00
	+ Perhaps dreams help us prepare to cope with real waking events
	+ Dreams sometimes simulate threatening events so that people can rehearse strategies for coping
	+ Dreams may have adaptive value if rehearsal helps us survive and reproduce

## Cognitive Theory

Audio 0:15:25
+ Dreaming is similar to the activity we engage in when we are awake
	+ Construct simulations of the real world
	+ Draw on memories, knowledge, metaphors, and assumptions
+ The difference is that the cerebral cortex is cut off from external stimulation
+ Predicts that if we were awake, but cut off from external stimulation, our thoughts would have the same hallucinatory quality we experience in dreams

## Activation-Synthesis Theory
+ The brain tries to make sense of random brain activity that occurs during sleep by synthesizing the activity with stored memories
	+ Emotion centers (limbic system) in the brain are active, which explains the intense emotions 
	+ Frontal cortices are not active, which explains the uncritical acceptance of illogical events
+ Critiques: 
	+ Dreams are not as chaotic as the activation-synthesis theory suggests
	+ Often similar to “everyday life” waking experience 

# ICA 12
+ Think of a dream you had recently
+ Rate level of oddness & threat (1-10)
+ Consider which theory applies best
	+ Which do you think is most accurate? Why?
+ Do you think dreams have meaning?

# Chapter 5 (Part 2): Body Rhythms & Mental States

# Drugs

## Many People Use Drugs
+ Audio 0:32:00
+ Drugs have been used throughout history to create altered states
+ Around 250 million people use illicit drugs each year
	+ U.S. is 3rd largest country at around 320 million, Indonesia is 4th at 252 million
+ Other widely-used drugs include alcohol, prescription medications, caffeine, and nicotine
	+ ![drugs](http://i.imgur.com/Uexf2pI.png)
+ Double-edged sword of drug use:
	+ Drugs are useful in the treatment of many medical conditions
	+ Recreational drug use can have negative consequences
+ Psychoactive drugs:
	+ Mind altering substances that change the brain's neurochemistry (marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, MDMA, opiates)
+ Drug effects
	+ The effects of a particular drug depends on which neurotransmitter system it activates (e.g., methamphetamine acts on the dopamine system)

+ Commonly used drugs:

	+ Cocaine
	+ Amphetamines          Stimulants
	+ MDMA

	+ Opium
	+ Heroin                 Opiates
	+ Morphine

	+ Alcohol               Depressants
	+ Tranquilizers


	+ LSD
	+ Psilocybin               Psychedelics
	+ Marijuana

## What are their effects?
+ Stimulants
	+ Speed up activity in the central nervous system
+ Depressants
	+ Slow down activity in the central nervous system
+ Opiates
	+  Relieve pain
+ Psychedelics
	+ Disrupt normal thought process (e.g., time, space)
