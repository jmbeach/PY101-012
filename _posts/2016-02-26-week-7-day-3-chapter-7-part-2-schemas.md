# Week 7 - Day 3 (Chapter 7 - part 2 - Schemas)

Quizlet: [https://quizlet.com/\_22fu12](https://quizlet.com/_22fu12)

**Schema**

- Networks of knowledge, beliefs, associations, and expectations
  - ooFor example, you could have a schematic response
- Schemas are adaptive in that they enable us to make quick judgments with little effort
  - ooEx: Think about a doctor
    - You might come up with
      - Lab coat
      - Nurse
      - Stressed
      - Wealthy
      - Hospital
      - Fear
      - Educated
      - Brave
      - Heroic
      - Busy
      - Stethoscope
- We tend to remember schema-consistent information when information is ambiguous
  - ooFor example, if I were to tell you
  - ooJohn is a doctor he…
    - Works hard
    - Enjoys movies
    - Spends time with his family
    - Is well-educated
    - Creative
    - Has irregular schedule
    - Has two dogs
  - ooYou're more likely to remember
    - Works hard
    - Well-educated
  - ooIf I told you john was a doctor you'd remember
    - Enjoys movies
    - Creative
    - Has two dogs
- When you encounter a person who diverts from our schema, we are unlikely to adjust our schema, but more likely to adjust our perception of that person; make them an exception

How do we know schemas work this way?

- Study was done where people asked people
  - ooAre doctors educated
    - They answered quickly
  - ooDo doctors have eyes?
    - It was less quick
      - You have to link the schema of doctor to human

- If I say doctor, the schema of nurse becomes more accessible to me
- Doctor might bring up the following connections
  - ooMedical doctor
  - ooParent
  - ooDoctor who
  - ooProfessor

Which would you pick

- In the first program there is %100 probability that 1/3 patients are saved
- In the second, there is 1/3 possibility that all are saved and 2/3 probability that nobody is saved.

**Scripts**

- Essentially behavioral schemas
- Shaped by culture
- What is your script for going to the movies?
  - ooIn a group
  - ooGoing to buy popcorn or soda
  - ooGo to theater and sit quietly
- You don't have to think about it, you just do it
- You probably have a behavioral script for class
  - ooYou sit down
  - ooYou take notes
  - ooYou might respond when he asks questions
  - ooWhen you leave, you no longer act with your student script

Schemas

- The schemas and scripts that children learn are likely to affect their behavior when they are older
- Cognitive schemas allow for easy, fast processing of information about people based on their membership in certain groups
  - ooStereotypes
- Almost every individual is stereotyped in some way
  - ooDo you think this is useful?
  - ooIn what ways could schemas like stereotypes be adaptive?

Solve this riddle

- A father and son are in a horrible car crash that kills the dad. The son is rushed to the hospital. Just as he's about to go under the knife, the surgeon says, "I can't operate - that boy is my son!"
- Explain how this could be true
- Answer: The surgeon is the boy's mother
  - ooGender roles=schemas
- That's how schemas can be detrimental. If it took you a moment, you don't picture doctors as females

Modes of thinking

- Automatic vs. Controlled Processes
  - oo **Automatic**
    - Picking up on someone else's emotions
  - oo **Controlled**
    - Ex: doing a math problem
- Subconscious process
  - ooMental processes outside of conscious awareness but accessible when necessary.
  - ooDriving a car, typing
- Nonconscious processes
  - ooMental processes occurring outside of and not available to conscious awareness
  - ooCan't be retrieved or elaborated on
  - ooExample: impression formation
    - Positive mood -> meet a new person -> favorable impression
- _Implicit learning_: Learning that occurs when you acquire knowledge about something without being aware of how you did so
  - ooLearning to ride a bike vs. learning to walk up the stairs
    - You can't elaborate or remember how that process was learned.

What keeps us from thinking rationally

- In a perfect world we would think in algorithms
  - oo_Algorithm_
    - A procedure that, if followed correctly, will always yield the correct answer
- We think in **Heuristics**
  - ooHeuristic thinking often occurs unconsciously and allows us to free up some cognitive resources
  - ooHeuristic thinking can be adaptive in that it allows us to decide quickly rather than weighing all the evidence
- Consider the following
  - ooWhat makes you more uncomfortable, riding in a car or in an airplane?
  - ooHave you ever wished someone a "good flight"?
  - ooHave you ever wished someone a "good drive" to work?
  - ooHow do you explain these differences?
    - Control
    - How much you're exposed to either
    - News covers these accidents more
-  **Availability heuristic**
  - ooMaking a decision based on the answer that most easily comes to mind

Come back to which would you pick (reworded)

- 100% probability that 2/3 die
- 33% probability that no one dies and 2/3 that all will die

Changing representations

- In problem solving, we often need to revise a mental representation to overcome an obstacle
  - oo **Restructuring**
- New view reveals a solution that was not clear

Task is to connect dots using at most 4 striaght lines
