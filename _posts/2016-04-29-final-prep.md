title: Final Prep

+ The final is in our normal classroom Friday at 11:30am

In case you have to make up a test (like me) on the day of the final, I have all of the 
Quizlets specific to each test broken up into folders:

+ [Test One Quizlets](https://quizlet.com/Jared_Beach/folders/py101-test-1)
+ [Test Two Quizlets](https://quizlet.com/Jared_Beach/folders/py-101-test-2)
+ [Test Three Quizlets](https://quizlet.com/Jared_Beach/folders/py-101-012-for-test-3)
+ [Test Four Quizlets](https://quizlet.com/Jared_Beach/folders/py-101-for-test-4)
    + I strongly recommend using the pro version of Quizlet to study these foldere because there is a new feature that
    allows you to study huge sets like these in chunks
        + Below is an example of how the pro version looks from studying for Test 2
            + ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/quizlet.png)
        + I'm sure that you'll be fine without the pro version too though
    + Other than that, all of the notes are available on this site and are downloadable as
    word documents. Maybe they can refresh your memory on some of the topics
    + Good luck!
