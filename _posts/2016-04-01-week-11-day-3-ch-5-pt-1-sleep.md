# Finishing up stress

## Coping Examples:
+ Anti-Stress Video Game
+ Exercise
+ Meditation
+ …what else?

## Meditation
+ Focus attention on external object or sense of awareness
+ Develop deep sense of tranquility
+ Goal: Quiet internal “voices”
+ Two general kinds:
  + Concentrative meditation: Focus on one thing (breathing, mental image, mantra)
  + Mindfulness meditation: Thoughts and emotions flow freely, paying attention to them, but not reacting to or judging them
		+ Audio 0:05:33
		+ Don't allow yourself to become to become emotionally involved in your thoughts
+ Possible benefits of meditation: 
  + Lower blood pressure
  + Improved blood lipids
  + Improved insulin resistance
  + Buffered against sadness
  + Preserved cognitive functioning in aging
  + Attention benefits
	+ (Covered the above vocab in last notes)

## Coping with Stress: Individual Differences
+ People differ in their perceptions of the amount of stress associated with various life events 
+ Stress resistant (“hardy”) people capable of adapting to life changes by viewing events constructively
	+ “Hardiness” has three components: 
		+ Commitment, Challenge, and Control
+ Stress-resilient people greater emotional flexibility and recover from threats more quickly than do those low in resilience 
+ Some researchers believe that people can learn to become more resilient
	+ Understanding when emotions are adaptive, learning to regulate emotions, and working on relationships with others

# Sleep

## Body Rhythms
+ Biological rhythms
	+ Periodic, more or less regular fluctuations in a biological system
	+ May or may not have psychological implications
	+ Come from different sources 
		+ External stimuli (e.g., daylight, temperature)
		+ Endogenous: generated from within rather by external cues
+ Examples
	+ Bears – hibernation
	+ Bird – migration
		+ Seasonal motive to fly south
	+ Humans – testosterone peaks in the fall and dips in the spring

Audio 0:12:50

## Circadian Rhythms
+ Biological rhythms within a period of about 24 hours 
	+ From peak to peak, from trough to trough
	+ Related to changes in light, air pressure, and temperature
	+ Affects hormone levels, urine levels, blood pressure, etc.
+ Controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)
	+ Receptors in the back of the eye  SCN  tells brain and body how to adapt
	+ Feedback loop between SCN and hormones/neurotransmitters
		+ SCN as controller
		+ Example: melatonin (sleep-inducing hormone)
			+ Audio 0:15:45

## Synchronization
+ Sometimes fall out of sync
	+ Internal desynchronization: a state in which biological rhythms are not in phase with one another
	+ Examples:
		+ Traveling across multiple time zones (i.e., jet lag)
		+ Staying up all night
	+ Sleep and wake patterns adjust quickly; temperature and hormone cycles may take several days to normalize
		+ Audio 0:18:00

## Long-term Rhythms
+ Some body rhythms may take place over longer periods of time
	+ Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)
		+ Sadness, lethargy, and drowsiness related to low light in winter months
		+ Often treated with phototherapy (sitting in front of fluorescent light for brief intervals)
	+ Menstrual cycle
		+ On average, 28-day cycle
		+ Hormone changes related to possible conception
			+ Changes in hormone could be relative to mood

# Sleep

## What is Sleep?
+ State of consciousness in which awareness of the outside world is mostly turned off
	+ The brain may not be aware of its surroundings, but it does not “shut down”
+ Sleep is a part of the normal rhythm of life
	+ Circadian rhythms
	+ The secretion of melatonin, which helps people fall asleep, is linked to light-dark cycles
	+ Sleep habits vary widely
		+ Some adults report needing 7 – 9 hours a night
			+ Audio 0:22:00
			+ Sleeping too much can actually make you develop psychological problems
		+ Some adults only need 1 – 2

## Stages of sleep
![sleep stages](http://i.imgur.com/1HS9owd.png)

  + alpha waves just before sleep
	+ stage 1
		+ you could wake up from this and not ever know you were asleep
			+ might feel like you're falling
			+ might seel interesting colors or shapes
	+ stage 2
		+ become more resiliant to external stimuli
		+ still atuned to alarm clock, baby crying, etc
		+ sleep spindles
			+ sudden bursts of activity in the brain
				+ we think it's the brain actively trying to keep you asleep
					+ we think this because they tend to happen after loud noises
		+ stage 3/4 (slow-wave sleep)
			+ deep sleep
			+ someone might have to shake you awake
			+ Audio 0:28:00
		+ REM
			+ dreaming
			+ Audio 0:34:30

## REM Sleep
+ The sleep cycle reverses after about 90 minutes 
+ Enter REM (paradoxical) stage
	+ Instead of waking up from sleep, you go into REM
+ Important because most dreaming occurs in REM sleep
+ Amount of time spent in REM increases 
	+ ![](http://i.imgur.com/n4XCwWx.png)
		+ You spend less and less time in the other stages

## Sleep Disorders
+ **Insomnia**: Difficulty falling or staying asleep
+ **Obstructive Sleep Apnea**: Breathing may stop hundreds of times per night
+ **Narcolepsy**: Sufferers unexpectedly fall asleep
	+ Audio 0:37:30
+ **REM Behavior Disorder**: Sufferers act out their dreams
+ **Somnambulism**: Sleep walking
	+ Happens a lot more with children
	+ Interestingly happens more often in slow-wave sleep

## Why Do We Sleep?
+ It’s adaptive, of course!
	+ This might seem counterintuitive
+ Sleep serves important biological purposes:
	+ Restoration
	+ Circadian rhythms
	+ Facilitation of learning/Consolidation

## Restoration
+ **Restorative Theory**: Sleep allows the body to rest and repair itself
+ The evidence:
	+ Sleep increases after strenuous physical activity
		+ Audio 0:40:30
	+ Growth hormones secreted in sleep
	+ Replenishes the brain’s energy stores 
	+ Strengthens the immune system 
		+ immune system tries to repair itself
+ **Effects of sleep deprivation**: 
	+ Mood problems (e.g., irritability)
	+ Problems with cognitive performance (e.g., attention and short-term memory lapses)
	+ May compromise the immune system
	+ Falling asleep for a few seconds to a minute (microsleeps) can impair ability to perform critical tasks (e.g., driving)

## Circadian Rhythms
+ **Circadian rhythm theory**: 
+ Many creatures are quiet and inactive during the night because darkness is the time when danger is highest 
+ Sleeping reduces risk of exposure to predators

	+ Audio 0:44:25

## Facilitation of Learning
+ **Sleep** strengthens neural connections needed for learning to occur
	+ Research shows memory in participants who slept was greater than those who didn’t 
	+ REM and slow-wave (stages 3 & 4) important for learning to take place
	+ Sleep may assist in problem-solving
		+ Volunteers trained on a math procedure that they would on an exam later
		+ They were not told about a hidden shortcut that would greatly reduce their work
		+ Those that slept for eight hours at night were 3 times more likely to discover the shortcut
			+ Audio 0:48:13
	+ Students spend more time in REM during exam periods
