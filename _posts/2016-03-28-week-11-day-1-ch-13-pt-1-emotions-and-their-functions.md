![fear](http://i.imgur.com/uWMMf7E.png)

## Facial Feedback Hypothesis
+ Mold facial muscles to mimic an emotion: activate the associated emotion
  + Facial expression triggers the experience of the emotion
  + ![face can make you feel](http://i.imgur.com/blfAkCu.png)
    + People holding it like the girl on the left found jokes funnier than people holding it like the girl on the right

		+ when you make yourself laugh, it makes you happier

## Cannon-Bard Theory
Audio 0:21:00
+ Experience two separate things at roughly the same time: an emotion & a physical reaction
  + Describes that the reactions are not because of the stimulus, it's the emotion
+ ![bear](http://i.imgur.com/KEWh5ag.png)

## The Schacter-Singer 2-Factor Theory
+ How arousal is labeled determines the experience of emotion
  + **Appraisals**: beliefs, perceptions, expectations, and judgments that people use to explain their own and others’ behaviors, including which emotion a person will feel in a given circumstance
  + ![two factor](http://i.imgur.com/N1Hpkpu.png)
