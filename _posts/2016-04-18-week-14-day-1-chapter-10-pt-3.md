# Chapter 10 pt 3 

## Attitudes
+ People's evaluations of objects, events, or ideas
	+ Can be trivial (favorite soda) or grand issues (religion, politics)
	+ We can be aware of them or not
	+ They can be simple or complex
+ Attitudes are shaped by social context, and they play an important role in how we evaluate and interact with other people
+ People tend to develop negative attitudes about new things more quickly than they develop positive attitudes about them
+ familiarity effect: The more we are exposed to something, the more we tend to like it

## Attitudes can be learned
+ Attitudes are acquired through classical conditioning (e.g., advertisers associate products with celebrities) 
+ Attitudes can also be learned through operant conditioning (e.g., rewarding a student for studying may create a positive attitude toward studying)
+ Attitudes are also shaped through socialization

## What determines if attitudes translate into behavior?

+ Stronger, more personally relevant attitudes are more likely to predict behavior
	+ Someone who grew up in a strongly Democratic household is more likely to register as a Democrat and vote Democratic than someone who grew up in a more politically neutral environment
		+ Audio 0:11:39.088260 
+ *Attitude specificity*: The more specific the attitude, the more predictive it is
+ Attitudes formed through direct experience tend to predict behavior better
	+ Audio 0:13:46.153809 
+ Attitude accessibility: Easily activated attitudes are more stable, predictive of behavior, and resistant to change

## Attitudes can function at different levels of cognitive awareness
+ *Explicit attitudes*: attitudes that a person can report
+ *Implicit attitudes*: attitudes that influence a person’s feelings and behavior at an unconscious level
+ People higher in self-reported (explicit) prejudice were less likely to vote for Obama
+ People who reported low levels of prejudice but whose scores on an implicit measure indicated negative attitudes about African Americans were also less likely to vote for Obama
	+ Even if you're not aware of it, your attitudes affect your actions
+ Implicit-Association Test [https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html)
	+ Audio 0:19:55.419938 

## What happens when attributes and behaviors don't line up?
+ *Research example (Festinger & Carlsmith, 1959)*:
	+ Participants performed an extremely boring task 
		+ Turning pegs a quarter of the way around for an hour
	+ Then, reported to other participants on how enjoyable it was
		+ Did not lie
		+ Paid $20
		+ Paid $1
	+ Asked to report how much they ACTUALLY liked the task
+ Which group do you think reported liking it the most?
	+ The lying, highly paid group (my guess)
	+ Actual: Paid $1 to lie
		+ Told themselves they must like if they'd lie about enjoying it for a dollar
+ Why??
	+ Discrepancy between attitudes and behavior led to an aversive emotional state (dissonance)
	+ Dissonance motivated people to reconcile these attitudes and behavior
+ Insufficient justification led to attitude change
+ *Cognitive dissonance*: an uncomfortable mental state due to a contradiction between two attitudes or between an attitude and a behavior
	+ Example: People experience cognitive dissonance when they smoke even though they know that smoking might kill them
+ People reduce dissonance by changing their attitudes or behaviors
They sometimes also rationalize or trivialize the discrepancies

## Dissonance
+ Dissonance can also arise when a person holds positive attitudes about different options but has to choose one of the options
+ *Postdecisional dissonance*
	+ Motivates the person to focus on the positive aspects of the chosen option and on the negative aspects of the unchosen option(s)
	+ Effect occurs automatically, with minimal cognitive processing, and apparently without awareness

## Spreading of Alternatives
+ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/spreading.png)
	+ participants defended their original choice
		+ Audio 0:33:38.456987 

## “Us vs. Them”
+ Think of any major conflict going on in the world
	+ How many are related to some type of group identity, group need, or group goal?
+ Evolutionarily, personal survival has depended on group survival
	+ Audio 0:35:47.148997 
	+ Keeping resources within a group while denying resources to outgroup members may have provided a selective advantage
		+ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/favoritemusic.png)
	+ Which picture of James Franko do you think he would like better?
		+ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/franko.png)
		+ The mirrored one because that's the way he's used to looking at himself
		+ we look at ourselves in the mirror

## Types of groups
+ Groups to which we belong are *ingroups*; those to which we do not belong are *outgroups*
	+ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/groups.png)
+ *Social identity*: the part of a person’s self concept that is based on his or her identification with a nation, religious group, political group, occupation, or other social affiliation
	+ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/groupchart.png)

## Us vs Them
+ People have strong emotional connections to these different identities
	+ The more central a given identity is to a person’s sense of self, the greater emotional investment
+ *Ethnocentrism*
	+ The belief that one’s own ethnic group, nation, or religion is superior to all others
	+ Universal phenomenon
	+ This belief increases commitment to group identity, influences behaviors
		+ Audio 0:40:01.820099 
		+ Might motivate negative behavior

## Who are we talking about?
+ Audio 0:41:02.767803 
1. They are all the same
2. They can't contribute to society in a meaningful way
3. They can't drive well
4. Weak and helpless
5. Set in their ways
6. Can't understand technology
	+ We're talking about old people

## Stereotypes 
+ Summary impression of a group, in which a person believes that all members of the group share a common trait or traits
	+ Audio 0:42:39.825108 
+ Allow for easy, fast processing of social information
+ Occur automatically, largely outside of our awareness
+ Affect impression formation
+ Universal phenomenon
+ Nationality: American, British, French, Italian, etc.
	+ have certain pre-defined ideas about what these nationalities are like
+ Ethnic group: White, Black, Hispanic, Asian American, etc.
+ Age: teens vs. old people, “millenials”, “baby boomers”
+ Ideological: liberal vs. conservative, religious vs. atheistic
+ Role-specific stereotypes: “soccer mom”, professor
	+ soccer mom ex:
		+ has kids. drives a mini-van
+ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/yins.png)
+ Can be positive, negative, or neutral
	+ Positive: welcoming, kind, polite
	+ Negative: uneducated, overweight, don’t wear shoes
	+ Neutral: conservative, like country music, “y’all”
		+ Audio 0:46:18.246034
