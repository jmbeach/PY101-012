# Personality

## Stages of Psychosexual Development

### Oral Stage (birth – 18 months)

+ Conflict = the weaning process
	+ The child must become less dependent upon caretakers
+ Stingy mom -> fixation -> oral character = pessimism, envy, suspicion and sarcasm, trust issue
Over indulgent mom  fixation  oral character = optimistic, gullible, and is full of admiration for others, dependency issues
+ Oral fixation can result in problems with drinking, eating, smoking, or nail biting

### Anal Stage (2-3 years)

+ Conflict = toilet training
+ The child has to learn to control his or her bodily needs
+ Developing this control leads to a sense of accomplishment and independence
+ Success depends on the parents’ approach
+ Parents who utilize praise and rewards encourage positive outcomes and help children feel capable and productive
+ Parents too lenient  fixation  anal-expulsive personality = a messy wasteful or destructive personality
+ Parents too strict or begin toilet training too early  fixation  anal-retentive personality = a  stringent, orderly, rigid and obsessive personality

### Phallic Stage (3-5 years)
+ Conflict = Oedipus complex, Electra complex, castration anxiety, penis envy
+ “I’m going to marry Daddy (Mommy) when I grow up”
+ Boys: castration anxiety causes boys to reject desires for their mother, adopt father’s standards of conscience and morality
	+ Audio 0:14:52.338525
	+ The idea that a young boy seeing a naked woman would think they were castrated and then act like their dad out of fear
+ Girls: have no motivation (i.e., fear of castration) to identify strongly with either parent, thus develop strong superego
+ Not learning to identity with parent of same sex  Fixation *phallic character* = reckless, resolute, self-assured, and narcissistic (excessively vain and proud)
	+ Can cause a person to be afraid or incapable of close love 

### Latency Period (6-puberty)
+ No conflict
+ Libido is suppressed
+ Ego and superego develop more
+ Important in the development of social and communication skills and self-confidence

### Genital Stage (puberty-death)
+ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/stagesofdevelopment.png)
+ No conflict
+ Goal = to become a well balanced, healthy person
+ Individuals develops sexual interest
+ Growing interest in welfare of others
+ If all stages completed successfully, individuals should be well-balanced, warm and caring
+ If fixated at any early stage, development will be troubled, with further struggle with repression and defenses.

## Projective Measures
+ Personality tests that examine unconscious processes by having people interpret ambiguous stimuli
	+ Based in psychodynamic theory
+ Examples
	+ Rorschach inkblot test
	+ Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)
+ The general idea is that people will reveal hidden aspects of personality such as motives, wishes, and unconscious conflicts
	+ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/inkblot.png)

## Thermic Apperception Test (TAT)
+ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tat.png)

## Humanistic Approach
+ Seeks to understand personality by focusing on how people seek to fulfill their potential through greater self-understanding
	+ Audio 0:26:33.862427
+ Features of Humanist Approaches
	+ Emphasizes personal experience
	+ Considers belief systems
	+ Views humans as unique
	+ Sees humans as basically good
+ Abraham Maslow
	+ Peak experiences: rare moments of rapture caused by the attainment of excellence or the experience of beauty
	+ Self-actualization: striving for a life that is meaningful, challenging, and satisfying

### Carl Roger's Humanistic Theory of Personality
+ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/carlrogers.png)
	+ Audio 0:28:49.213278
	+ Describes processes which lead to you becoming the best version of you

## Objective Measures

+ Relatively direct assessments of personality, usually based on information gathered through self-report questionnaires or observer ratings
	+ Require written responses
+ Often a large inventory of traits:
	+ Myers-Briggs (types)
	+ Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)
+ Trait approaches: focus on how individuals differ in personality dispositions, such as sociability, cheerfulness, and aggressiveness
	+ Audio 0:32:04.803851
+ Early Models: Eysenck’s Hierarchical Model
	+ The basic structure of this model included:
		+ Specific response level
		+ Habitual response level
	+ Superordinate traits
		+ Introversion/extraversion
		+ Emotional stability
			+ Audio 0:32:32.539550
		+ Psychoticism (i.e., constraint)

## The Big Five
+ *Five-factor model*: identifies five basic personality traits
	+ For each factor, there is a continuum from low to high
	+ Each factor is a higher-order trait that is made up of interrelated lower-order traits
	+ People’s “scores” on the Big Five traits have been shown to predict a wide variety of different behaviors (e.g., conscientiousness predicts grades in college)
+ The Big Five approach currently dominates how many psychologists study personality
	+ Audio 0:33:52.799695

### O.C.E.A.N.
+ Openness to Experience
	+ The breadth, depth, originality, and complexity of an individual’s mental and experiential life
+ Conscientiousness
	+ Socially prescribed impulse control that facilitates task- and goal-oriented behavior
		+ Audio 0:35:17.980912
+ Extraversion
	+ An energetic approach to the social and material world
+ Agreeableness
	+ A prosocial and communal orientation toward others
+ Neuroticism
	+ The opposite of emotional stability and even-temperedness
+ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/big5.png)
+ Relatively consistent across populations
+ Specific patterns of change over time
	+ The maturity principle: increases in agreeableness and conscientiousness, decreases in neuroticism into middle age
		+ Audio 0:38:21.171625
		+ We become more mature, less neurotic, etc.

## The Big Five in animals
+ Just like humans, nonhuman animals display consistent individual differences in behaviors across settings and circumstances
+ Found in 64 different species
+ Personality traits that are most prominent in nonhuman animals
	+ Extraversion
	+ Neuroticism
	+ Agreeableness
