## Where does personality come from?

### Genetic vs. learned?

+ Temperament
	+ Physiological disposition to respond to the environment in certain ways
		+ Audio 0:08:16.491145
	+ Present in infancy, assumed to be innate
		+ To some extent genetic
	+ Relatively stable over time
		+ Audio 0:09:12.580248
+ Includes…
	+ Reactivity
	+ Soothability
		+ Audio 0:09:35.591669
	+ Positive and negative emotionality

## Heritability of personality
+ Heritability
	+ A statistical estimate of the proportion of the total variance in some trait that is attributable to genetic differences among individuals within a group
+ Heritability of personality traits is about 50 percent
	+ Within a group of people, about 50 percent of the variation associated with a given trait is attributable to genetic differences among individuals in the group
	+ The rest is environment
+ Genetic predisposition is not genetic inevitability

## Environmental influences
+ Non-shared environment: unique aspects of a person’s environment and experience that are not shared with family members
+ Partially explains why siblings raised in the same home would not have identical personalities
	+ Not every encounter each sibling has is shared by the other(s)
+ Culture
	+ individualist vs. collectivist
	+ agricultural vs herding society -> "culture of honor" -> aggressiveness
	+ Life experiences and role changes
		+ Audio 0:19:22.921496
	+ Going to college, job responsibilities, traveling, long-term relationships, having children, etc.
+ (In a different study / different graph)
	+ [A study](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/92155/InsultAggressionAndTheSouthernCulture.pdf) found that southern people have a stronger physiological reaction to altercation
		+ Audio 0:25:40.192140
			+ When called an asshole, they had significantly higher cortisol levels than the northern subjects.
+ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/maturity.png)
	+ Audio 0:28:07.183955
		+ Graph shows that you might have an abrupt spike in maturity after a traumatic or serious life event.
			+ I.E becoming a parent gives you a slower spike
			+ Being exposed to a disaster like the April 27th tornado makes you spike in maturity all at once.

## Strong Situation
+ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/death.png)
	+ Audio 0:31:06.283555

## Weak Situation
+ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/weak.png)
	+ Audio 0:31:43.605402

## Interaction of Personality and Situation
+ Reciprocal determinism
	+ Two-way interaction between aspects of the environment and aspects of the individual in the shaping of personality traits
+ ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/situation.png)
+ Ultimately, personality reflects:
+ A person’s underlying disposition
+ The activation of the person’s goals in a particular situation
+ The activation of the person’s emotional responses in the pursuit of those goals
