## Social Influence

+ Who is more influential during adolescence, parents or friends?  

# The Transition to Old Age

+ Questions people ask themselves:
	+ Is it okay to be who I was?
	+ Become isolated easier
		+ Less connected
+ People are living longer
+ The number of people over age 85 is growing dramatically
	+ Better medicine


## The elderly contribute much to modern society

+ Many older adults work productively well past their 70s
	+ Supreme court
		Most are over the age of 85
	+ Morgan Freeman
		Still acting
	+ Paul Simon
		+ Still touring
 
## Deterioration

+ The body and mind start deteriorating slowly at about age 50
	+ Adolescents continue growing until your 25
		+ Your brain stops growing after this
	+ 50 starts going backward
+ Trivial physical changes include the graying and whitening of hair and the 
wrinkling of skin
	+ Surface level changes
+ Some of the most serious changes affect the brain, where frontal lobes shrink proportionally more than other brain regions
	+ Frontal lobes are center of higher cognitive thought
	+ Explains why older people have trouble remembering things or keeping up with things and learning new technologies
	+ Exacerbated in some individuals

		+ The brain of someone with Alzheimer's has physically afflicted brain
			+ Where you would normally find the hippocampus, there is nothing there
## Cognitive changes
+ It is difficult to pinpoint the causes of cognitive decline in old age
	+ Perhaps if someone older stops reading, their brain loses some strength
+ The frontal lobes, which play an important role in working memory and many other cognitive skills, typically shrink as people grow older
	+ People with impaired hearing won't participate in conversation because they lose the ability to engage as much
		+ Causes a more general decline in mental ability
+ Types of changes
	+ Slowing of mental processing speed
	+ Sensory-perceptual changes
	+ Sensitivity to sensory information
		+ Someone driving really slow might be worried because they are processing sensory information slower
## Changes in Memory
+ Long-term memory is less affected by aging than is working memory
	+ Childhood stories are safe
	+ Working memory includes someone telling you their phone number
		+ Usually stays in a normal brain for a minute, then it's gone
	+ Multitasking suffers
+ Older people often need more time to learn new information
	+ Once they learned, they use it as efficiently as younger people 
	+ Especially true for recognition tasks
+ One reason for the decline in memory related to aging is that older adults tend not to use strategies that facilitate memory
	+ They don't have life-styles that promote learning
	+ They have a routine often
		+ Eat and do the same things every day
+ Another reason for declines in working memory is age-related reductions in dopamine activity in the frontal lobes
	+ Dopamine is related to reward
	+ Not as rewarded by environmental stimuli
## Changes in Intelligence
+ Research has indicated consistently that intelligence, as measured on standard psychometric tests, declines with advanced age
	+ They have a harder time with IQ tests
+ Fluid intelligence vs. Crystallized intelligence
	+ Fluid intelligence refers to the ability to process new general information without specific prior knowledge
		+ IQ requires fluid
		+ This is analyzing something you've never seen before and finding a solution
	+ Crystallized intelligence refers to specific knowledge that must be learned or memorized
		+ Things you've already learned
			+ Older people excel at this
			+ Older people can even grow this 
+ Crystallized intelligence usually increases throughout life
+ Although memory and the speed of processing may decline, the continued ability to learn new information may mitigate those losses in terms of daily functioning
## Positive Changes in Adulthood
+ Except for dementia, older adults have fewer mental health problems, including depression, than younger adults
	+ Most are pretty content
	+ Even with chronic or daily pain, most end up happier
+ Socioemotional selectivity theory 
	+ As people grow older, they perceive time to be limited
	+ As a result, they adjust their priorities to emphasize emotionally meaningful events, experiences, and goals
	+ Older people show better memory for positive than for negative information
