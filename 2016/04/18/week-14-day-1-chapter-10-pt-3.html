<h2 id="attitudes">Attitudes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>People’s evaluations of objects, events, or ideas
    <ul>
      <li>Can be trivial (favorite soda) or grand issues (religion, politics)</li>
      <li>We can be aware of them or not</li>
      <li>They can be simple or complex</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Attitudes are shaped by social context, and they play an important role in how we evaluate and interact with other people</li>
  <li>People tend to develop negative attitudes about new things more quickly than they develop positive attitudes about them</li>
  <li>familiarity effect: The more we are exposed to something, the more we tend to like it</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="attitudes-can-be-learned">Attitudes can be learned</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Attitudes are acquired through classical conditioning (e.g., advertisers associate products with celebrities)</li>
  <li>Attitudes can also be learned through operant conditioning (e.g., rewarding a student for studying may create a positive attitude toward studying)</li>
  <li>Attitudes are also shaped through socialization
Would you eat a worm?
    <ul>
      <li><img src="/PY101-012/images/celebs.png" alt="" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-determines-if-attitudes-translate-into-behavior">What determines if attitudes translate into behavior?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Stronger, more personally relevant attitudes are more likely to predict behavior
    <ul>
      <li>Someone who grew up in a strongly Democratic household is more likely to register as a Democrat and vote Democratic than someone who grew up in a more politically neutral environment
        <ul>
          <li>Audio 0:11:39.088260</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Attitude specificity</em>: The more specific the attitude, the more predictive it is</li>
  <li>Attitudes formed through direct experience tend to predict behavior better
    <ul>
      <li>Audio 0:13:46.153809</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Attitude accessibility: Easily activated attitudes are more stable, predictive of behavior, and resistant to change</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="attitudes-can-function-at-different-levels-of-cognitive-awareness">Attitudes can function at different levels of cognitive awareness</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em>Explicit attitudes</em>: attitudes that a person can report</li>
  <li><em>Implicit attitudes</em>: attitudes that influence a person’s feelings and behavior at an unconscious level</li>
  <li>People higher in self-reported (explicit) prejudice were less likely to vote for Obama</li>
  <li>People who reported low levels of prejudice but whose scores on an implicit measure indicated negative attitudes about African Americans were also less likely to vote for Obama
    <ul>
      <li>Even if you’re not aware of it, your attitudes affect your actions</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="what-happens-when-attributes-and-behaviors-dont-line-up">What happens when attributes and behaviors don’t line up?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em>Research example (Festinger &amp; Carlsmith, 1959)</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>Participants performed an extremely boring task
        <ul>
          <li>Turning pegs a quarter of the way around for an hour</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Then, reported to other participants on how enjoyable it was
        <ul>
          <li>Did not lie</li>
          <li>Paid $20</li>
          <li>Paid $1</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Asked to report how much they ACTUALLY liked the task</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Which group do you think reported liking it the most?
    <ul>
      <li>The lying, highly paid group (my guess)</li>
      <li>Actual: Paid $1 to lie
        <ul>
          <li>Told themselves they must like if they’d lie about enjoying it for a dollar</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Why??
    <ul>
      <li>Discrepancy between attitudes and behavior led to an aversive emotional state (dissonance)</li>
      <li>Dissonance motivated people to reconcile these attitudes and behavior</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Insufficient justification led to attitude change</li>
  <li><em>Cognitive dissonance</em>: an uncomfortable mental state due to a contradiction between two attitudes or between an attitude and a behavior
    <ul>
      <li>Example: People experience cognitive dissonance when they smoke even though they know that smoking might kill them</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>People reduce dissonance by changing their attitudes or behaviors
They sometimes also rationalize or trivialize the discrepancies</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dissonance">Dissonance</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Dissonance can also arise when a person holds positive attitudes about different options but has to choose one of the options</li>
  <li><em>Postdecisional dissonance</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Motivates the person to focus on the positive aspects of the chosen option and on the negative aspects of the unchosen option(s)</li>
      <li>Effect occurs automatically, with minimal cognitive processing, and apparently without awareness</li>
      <li><img src="/PY101-012/images/dissonance.png" alt="" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="spreading-of-alternatives">Spreading of Alternatives</h2>
<ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="us-vs-them">“Us vs. Them”</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Think of any major conflict going on in the world
    <ul>
      <li>How many are related to some type of group identity, group need, or group goal?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Evolutionarily, personal survival has depended on group survival
    <ul>
      <li>Audio 0:35:47.148997</li>
      <li>Keeping resources within a group while denying resources to outgroup members may have provided a selective advantage
        <ul>
          <li><img src="/PY101-012/images/favoritemusic.png" alt="" /></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Which picture of James Franko do you think he would like better?
        <ul>
          <li><img src="/PY101-012/images/franko.png" alt="" /></li>
          <li>The mirrored one because that’s the way he’s used to looking at himself</li>
          <li>we look at ourselves in the mirror</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="us-vs-them-1">Us vs Them</h2>
<ul>
  <li>People have strong emotional connections to these different identities
    <ul>
      <li>The more central a given identity is to a person’s sense of self, the greater emotional investment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Ethnocentrism</em>
    <ul>
      <li>The belief that one’s own ethnic group, nation, or religion is superior to all others</li>
      <li>Universal phenomenon</li>
      <li>This belief increases commitment to group identity, influences behaviors
        <ul>
          <li>Audio 0:40:01.820099</li>
          <li>Might motivate negative behavior</li>
