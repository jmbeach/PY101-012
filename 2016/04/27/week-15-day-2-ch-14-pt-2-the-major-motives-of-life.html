<ul>
  <li>Audio 0:02:03.564036</li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="biology-of-love">Biology of love</h3>
  </li>
  <li>Neurological origins of passionate love begin in infancy, when infants attach to the mother</li>
  <li>Hormones involved in pleasure and reward are activated in the mother–baby bond and in the pair bond of adult lovers
    <ul>
      <li>Vasopressin, oxytocin</li>
      <li>Increasing these oxytocin leads to:
        <ul>
          <li>Greater trust in risky situations</li>
          <li>Audio 0:02:55.228834</li>
          <li>Greater affection (e.g., gazing, touching) among romantic couples</li>

      <li>Euphoria of endorphins may be initial motivation for affection</li>
      <li>“We are addicted to love”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Similar neural responses occur in adult relationships
    <ul>
      <li>Exhilaration of new love, physical and emotional distress of separation

          <li>Audio 0:08:07.336444</li>
          <li>Feel like you have to be with that person</li>
          <li>You can look at classic writing and people will describe longing when separated from a partner</li>
        </ul>

  <li>fMRIs have shown other neurological similarities between different types of love
    <ul>
      <li>Audio 0:09:16.885717</li>

<h2 id="attachment-theory-of-love">Attachment theory of love</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Audio 0:34:17.882358</li>
  <li>Like infants to their caregivers, adults have attachment styles to their partners
    <ul>
      <li>Idea is that the style carries over from childhood</li>
      <li>Secure: rarely jealous or worried about abandonment</li>
      <li>Anxious: agitated and worried partner will leave; clingy
        <ul>
          <li>Audio 0:36:04.331544
            <ul>
              <li>Need reassurance</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Physiological component – cortisol spikes when they feel the relationship is threatened
            <ul>
              <li>People with this attachment style have greater physiological responses
                <ul>
                  <li>Say the partner makes a new friend of the opposite sex, that would cause the avoidant partner’s heart-rate to increase</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Avoidant: distrustful; avoids intimate attachments</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>A person’s style of dealing with romantic partners seems to be based on how they were treated by their parents</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Children form internal “working models” for what relationships should be like (e.g., “Can I trust others?”)  adult relationships</li>
      <li>How your parents treat you seems to determine how you attach to relationships in your adult life
        <ul>
          <li>However, it is just pre-disposition, it is not certain you will have this attachment style</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="identify-attachment">Identify attachment</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Audio 0:39:43.233114</li>
  <li>“I find it difficult to trust people completely. I am somewhat uncomfortable being close to others. I feel nervous when people start to get too close. Often, I feel like people want me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable being. I find it difficult to allow myself to depend on other people.”</li>
  <li>Which attachment style does this describe?
    <ul>
      <li>a. Anxious</li>
      <li>b. Secure</li>
      <li>c. Avoidant

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="identify-attachment-1">Identify attachment</h2>
<ul>
  <li>“I find it relatively easy to get close to other people. I am comfortable depending on other people and having them depend on me. I don’t usually worry about being abandoned or about having someone get too close to me.”

    <ul>
      <li>a. Anxious</li>
      <li>b. Secure</li>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-sustains-love">What Sustains Love?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Romantic love fades, yes; but not for everyone
    <ul>

      <li>But, loses the obsessive component that fosters constant thought and worry</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Perception by both partners that the relationship is fair, rewarding, and balanced
    <ul>
      <li>Too many or too little benefits cause guilt or resentment, respectively</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dealing-with-conflict">Dealing with conflict</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The way a couple deals with conflict often determines whether the relationship will last</li>
  <li><em>Gottman (1994) describes four interpersonal styles that typically lead couples to discord and dissolution</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>Being overly critical</li>
      <li>Holding the partner in contempt</li>
      <li>Being defensive</li>
      <li>Mentally withdrawing from the relationship</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Attributional style also plays a role
    <ul>
      <li>Good outcomes -&gt; situation</li>
      <li>Bad outcomes -&gt; each other
        <ul>
          <li>Assigning the outcome of an event to be the partner’s fault</li>
