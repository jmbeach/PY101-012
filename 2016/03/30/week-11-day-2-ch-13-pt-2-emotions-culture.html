<ul>
  <li>Consistent pattern of responses to stress that consists of three stages:
    <ul>
      <li>Alarm: emergency reaction that prepares body to fight or flee
        <ul>
          <li>Body is most likely to be exposed to infection &amp; disease</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

        <ul>
          <li>Immunity somewhat increases as body maximizes defenses</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Exhaustion: variety of physiological and immune systems fail

  </li>
  <li>Tend-and-befriend (female-typical)
    <ul>
      <li>Protecting and caring for offspring, forming alliances with social groups to reduce risk of threat</li>
      <li>It is possible that the release of oxytocin during social stress encourages women to affiliate with or befriend others</li>

  <li>Stress alters the functions of the immune system
Audio 0:24:30
    <ul>
      <li>Psychoneuroimmunology: field in which the response of the body’s immune system to psychological variables is studied</li>

          <li>e.g., stressful jobs, poverty</li>
        </ul>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stress--heart-disease">Stress &amp; Heart Disease</h2>

        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Negative traits (e.g., hostility) and states (e.g., depression) combine to promote coronary heart disease</li>

<h1 id="coping-with-stress">Coping With Stress</h1>

<p>Audio 0:34:30</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Tg85aq6.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>To deal effectively with stressors we use cognitive appraisals that link feelings with thoughts</li>
  <li>Two-part cognitive appraisal process:
    <ul>
      <li>Primary appraisals: Decide whether stimuli are stressful, benign, or irrelevant</li>
      <li>Secondary appraisals: Once an event perceived as stressful, evaluate response options and choose coping strategies
        <ul>
          <li>Once you decide it’s stressful, how you cope</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Anticipatory coping: coping that occurs before the onset of a future stressor
    <ul>
      <li>You know it’s going to happen eventually, so you get ready for it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Two general coping categories:
    <ul>
      <li>Emotion-focused coping: a type of coping in which people try to prevent having an emotional response to a stressor
        <ul>
          <li>Tries to prevent having a response</li>
          <li>Try to rationalize a stressor</li>
          <li>If you are doing poorly in a class, you might avoid going to class
            <ul>
              <li>You might assert that you don’t need to go to class to get a job</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Problem-focused coping: a type of coping in which people take direct steps to confront a stressor or problem-solve
        <ul>
          <li>You’re doing poorly in a class, so you study even harder</li>
          <li>Goal oriented</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Most people use both emotion-focused coping and problem-focused coping</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Two strategies can facilitate positive thinking using positive reappraisal:
    <ul>
      <li>Learning from the experience</li>
      <li>Making social comparisons
    + Downward social comparisons are “At least I don’t have xyz problem”
        + Even people with cancer will do this and say “Well at least I don’t have a worse kind of cancer”
    + Upward social comparison: Look at a person who’s in the same situation as you, but doing better and asking why</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Social support!
  Audio 0:38:00
    <ul>
      <li>Friends, family members, neighbors, co-workers</li>
      <li>How might these relationships help to reduce stress?
        <ul>
          <li>Concern and affection</li>
          <li>Provide different perspectives</li>
          <li>Offer resources (e.g., money, help)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Biological impacts
        <ul>
          <li>High social support  heart rate and stress hormone levels normalize more quickly</li>
          <li>Low social support  chronic inflammation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="coping-with-stress-individual-differences">Coping with Stress: Individual Differences</h2>
<ul>
  <li>People differ in their perceptions of the amount of stress associated with various life events</li>
  <li>Stress resistant (“hardy”) people capable of adapting to life changes by viewing events constructively
    <ul>
      <li>“Hardiness” has three components:
        <ul>
          <li>Commitment, Challenge, and Control</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Stress-resilient people greater emotional flexibility and recover from threats more quickly than do those low in resilience</li>
  <li>Some researchers believe that people can learn to become more resilient
    <ul>
      <li>Understanding when emotions are adaptive, learning to regulate emotions, and working on relationships with others</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="coping-examples">Coping Examples</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Anti-Stress Video Game</li>
  <li>Exercise</li>
  <li>Meditation</li>
  <li>…what else?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="meditation">Meditation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Focus attention on external object or sense of awareness</li>
  <li>Develop deep sense of tranquility</li>
  <li>Goal: Quiet internal “voices”</li>
  <li>Two general kinds:
    <ul>
      <li>Concentrative meditation: Focus on one thing (breathing, mental image, mantra)</li>
      <li>Mindfulness meditation: Thoughts and emotions flow freely, paying attention to them, but not reacting to or judging them</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Possible benefits of meditation:
    <ul>
      <li>Lower blood pressure</li>
      <li>Improved blood lipids</li>
      <li>Improved insulin resistance</li>
      <li>Buffered against sadness</li>
      <li>Preserved cognitive functioning in aging</li>
      <li>Attention benefits</li>
    </ul>
