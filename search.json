REM dreams: More likely to be bizarre and include intense emotions, visual and auditory hallucinations, and uncritical acceptance of illogical events        Explanation:          Non-REM: General de-activation of many brain regions      REM: Brain structures associated with motivation, emotion, reward, vision are active; pre-frontal cortex is not      Lucid DreamsAudio 0:05:00  Dreams in which the dreamer is aware of dreaming          In some cases, the dreamer may be able to control the action in their dreams, much like a scriptwriter in a movie        Dr. Berit Brogaard          Knowing that you are dreaming      Being able to control your own dream actions in a wake-like fashion      Being able to manipulate your dream surroundings      Being able to manipulate the dream actions of other people in your dreams      Meaning  Psychoanalytic theory (Freud): Dreams contain hidden content that represents unconscious conflicts          Manifest content: The plot of a dream; the way the dream is remembered                  Audio 0:09:17                    Latent content: What a dream symbolizes; the material that is disguised in a dream to protect the dreams from confronting direct reality      No scientific evidence that dreams represent hidden conflicts or for the special symbolic meaning of dream images                                      Problem-Focused Theory  Question:          Why do people often dream about threatening events?        Answer:          Audio 0:13:00      Perhaps dreams help us prepare to cope with real waking events      Dreams sometimes simulate threatening events so that people can rehearse strategies for coping      Dreams may have adaptive value if rehearsal helps us survive and reproduce      Cognitive TheoryAudio 0:15:25  Dreaming is similar to the activity we engage in when we are awake          Construct simulations of the real world      Draw on memories, knowledge, metaphors, and assumptions        The difference is that the cerebral cortex is cut off from external stimulation  Predicts that if we were awake, but cut off from external stimulation, our thoughts would have the same hallucinatory quality we experience in dreamsActivation-Synthesis Theory  The brain tries to make sense of random brain activity that occurs during sleep by synthesizing the activity with stored memories          Emotion centers (limbic system) in the brain are active, which explains the intense emotions      Frontal cortices are not active, which explains the uncritical acceptance of illogical events        Critiques:          Dreams are not as chaotic as the activation-synthesis theory suggests      Often similar to everyday life waking experience      ICA 12  Think of a dream you had recently  Rate level of oddness &amp;amp; threat (1-10)  Consider which theory applies best          Which do you think is most accurate? Why?        Do you think dreams have meaning?Chapter 5 (Part 2): Body Rhythms &amp;amp; Mental StatesDrugsMany People Use Drugs  Audio 0:32:00  Drugs have been used throughout history to create altered states  Around 250 million people use illicit drugs each year          U.S. is 3rd largest country at around 320 million, Indonesia is 4th at 252 million        Other widely-used drugs include alcohol, prescription medications, caffeine, and nicotine                  Double-edged sword of drug use:          Drugs are useful in the treatment of many medical conditions      Recreational drug use can have negative consequences        Psychoactive drugs:          Mind altering substances that change the brains neurochemistry (marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, MDMA, opiates)        Drug effects          The effects of a particular drug depends on which neurotransmitter system it activates (e.g., methamphetamine acts on the dopamine system)            Commonly used drugs:          Cocaine      Amphetamines          Stimulants              MDMA            Opium      Heroin                 Opiates              Morphine            Alcohol               Depressants              Tranquilizers            LSD      Psilocybin               Psychedelics      Marijuana      What are their effects?

Concern and affection          Provide different perspectives          Offer resources (e.g., money, help)                    Biological impacts                  High social support  heart rate and stress hormone levels normalize more quickly          Low social support  chronic inflammation                    Coping with Stress: Individual Differences  People differ in their perceptions of the amount of stress associated with various life events  Stress resistant (hardy) people capable of adapting to life changes by viewing events constructively          Hardiness has three components:                  Commitment, Challenge, and Control                      Stress-resilient people greater emotional flexibility and recover from threats more quickly than do those low in resilience  Some researchers believe that people can learn to become more resilient          Understanding when emotions are adaptive, learning to regulate emotions, and working on relationships with others      Coping Examples  Anti-Stress Video Game  Exercise  Meditation  what else?Meditation  Focus attention on external object or sense of awareness  Develop deep sense of tranquility  Goal: Quiet internal voices  Two general kinds:          Concentrative meditation: Focus on one thing (breathing, mental image, mantra)      Mindfulness meditation: Thoughts and emotions flow freely, paying attention to them, but not reacting to or judging them        Possible benefits of meditation:          Lower blood pressure      Improved blood lipids      Improved insulin resistance      Buffered against sadness      Preserved cognitive functioning in aging      Attention benefits          Vocab            Term      Def                  Stress      pattern of behavior, psychological and physiological responses to events that match or exceed an organisms ability to respond in a healthy way              eustress      positive stress (ex: getting into college)              distress      negative stress (ex: being late to meeting)              stressor      environmental stimulus that threaten organisms              Coping response      response an organism makes to avoid, escape from, or minamize aversive stimuli              Yerkes-Dodson Law      Law that says stress increases performance to an extent until it becomes distressful              Cold Pressor Task      Task which is designed to make you stressed by making you put your hand in ice cold water (look at coping responses)              Alarm      emergency reaction that prepares body to fight or flee              Resistance      defenses prepare for longer, sustained attack against stressor              Exhaustion      variety of physiological and immune systems fail              HPA axis      System activated to energize the body to respond to stressors              Fight-or-flight      Response to stress in which heart rate increases and blood is distributed to muscles and brain              Tend-and-befriend      Reaction to stress in which the stressed individual protects and cares for offspring and forms alliances with groups to reduce risk of threat.

Among a sample of female students, those with certain genetic markers related to serotonin functioning were much more likely to show PTSD symptoms in the weeks after the shooting (Mercer et al., 2011).                                                        Those with PTSD often have chronic tension, anxiety, and health problems, and they may experience memory and attention problems in their daily lives. PTSD involves an unusual problem in memorythe inability to forget.                                                                            A theory is that people who are more prone to PTSD have a smaller hippocampus and it really feels like they&amp;#39;re experiencing this traumatic event over and over                                                                                                                    It really feels to these people that they are experiencing the event                                                                                    The lifetime prevalence of PTSD is around 7 percent; women are more likely to develop the disorder                                                    People who have babies tend to experience this too                            Panic disorder                            Panic disorder: consists of sudden, overwhelming attacks of terror                                                    Panic attacks typically last for several minutes. Victims sweat, tremble, feel their hearts racing; experience shortness of breath, chest pain; feel dizziness and light-headedness with numbness and tingling in their hands and feet.

People have long struggled with how best to understand psychopathology (mental disorder)                                    Earliest views of psychopathology explained apparent madness as resulting from possession by demons or evil spirits                                    During the last 200 years, recognition has grown that psychopathology reflects dysfunction of the body, particularly of the brain                Psychopathology is different from everyday problems                        Psychological disorders are common and account for the greatest proportion of disability in developed countries (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011)                                    Drawing the line between a normal emotional experience and a mental disorder can be difficult                                    When a psychological problem disrupts a persons life and causes significant distress over a long period, the problem is considered a disorder rather than the normal low points of everyday life                Pathology                            In determining whether behavior represents psychopathology, it is important to consider certain criteria:&amp;nbsp;                                                    Does the person act in a way that deviates from cultural norms for acceptable behavior?&amp;nbsp;                                                        Is the behavior maladaptive?&amp;nbsp;                                                        Is the behavior self-destructive?

Categories of Psychological Disorders                            1800s: Psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin identified mental disorders on the basis of groups of symptoms that occur together                                    In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association published the first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)                                    Disorders are described in terms of observable symptoms                                                    Patients must meet specific criteria to receive a particular diagnosis                                                Multiaxial system: assessment along five axes that describe important mental health factors                                                                                                    Categorical versus dimensional approach&amp;nbsp;                Comorbidity            Psychological disorders have many causes                        Biological and environmental factors are thought to play important developmental roles in psychopathology                                    Diathesis-stress model: a diagnostic model that proposes that a disorder may develop when an underlying vulnerability is coupled with a precipitating event                                                                                                                                        Biological factors                        The biological perspective focuses on how physiological factors contribute to psychological disorders:                                                    Genetics                                                        Prenatal problems (e.g., malnutrition, exposure to toxins, maternal illness)                                                        During childhood and adolescence, environmental toxins and malnutrition can put an individual at risk for mental disorders                                                Biological factors may contribute to mental disorders because of their effects on the central nervous system                                                    Functional neuroimaging is currently at the forefront of research into the neurological components of mental disorders                                                        PET and fMRI have revealed brain regions that may function differently in individuals with mental disorders                            Psychological factors                            Psychological factors play an important role in the expression and treatment of mental disorders                                    Family systems model: An individuals behavior must be considered within a social context, particularly within the family                                                    Problems that arise within an individual are manifestations of problems within the family                                                Sociocultural model: Psychopathology is the result of the interaction between individuals and their cultures                                                    Differences in occurrence of disorders are due to differences in lifestyles, in expectations, and in opportunities between classes                                Cognitive-behaviroal factors                        The central principle of the cognitive-behavioral approach is that abnormal behavior is learned                                                    Proponents of strict behaviorism argue that mental disorders result from classical and operant conditioning                                                According to the revised cognitive-behavioral perspective, thoughts and beliefs are types of behavior and can be studied empirically                                                    The premise of this approach is that thoughts can become distorted and produce maladaptive behaviors and maladaptive emotions                                        Anxiety disorders        Can anxiety be the root of seemingly different disorders?                        Anxiety itself is normal and even useful                                                    It can prepare us for upcoming events and motivate us to learn new ways of coping with lifes challenges                                                Anxiety can become debilitating and can interfere with every aspect of life                                    Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive anxiety in the absence of true danger                Different types of anxiety disorders                        More than 1 in 4 Americans will have some type of anxiety disorder during their lifetimes                                    Different anxiety disorders share some emotional, cognitive, somatic, and motor symptoms, even though the behavioral manifestations of these disorders are quite different                                    Because chronic stress can damage the body, including the brain, it is very important to identify and effectively treat disorders that involve chronic anxiety                Phobic disorders                        A phobia is a fear of a specific object or situation                                    Specific phobias affect about 1 in 8 people and involve particular objects and situations                                                    Blood-injection-injury type                                                        Animals                                                        Elements of physical environment                                                        Disasters                                                Social phobia is a fear of being negatively evaluated by others                                                    Includes fears of public speaking, speaking up in class, meeting new people, and eating in front of others                                                                                                                                                                psychopathology                                        Study of mental disorders                                                        Multiaxial system                                        System which asseses mental health factors along five axes                                                        Axis 1                                        Part of multiaxial system.

Identity is made up of memories, including recollections and knowledge of skills  Memories are often incomplete, biased, and distorted  Can you think of an instance where you and a friend or relative have had different memories of the same event?

Teaching someone to perform a complex task requires more than reinforcing arbitrary correct behaviors  We learn many behaviors, including attitudes, through observation   Observational learning          ooThe acquisition or modification of a behavior after exposure to at least one performance of that behavior            Observational learning is a powerful adaptive tool for humans and other animals    There are several ways that behavior, thoughts, and attitudes can be learned through observationMemes-   ooA unit of knowledge transmitted within a culture  ooAnalogous to genes      ooTransmission of learning at the cultural level    Memes can be conditioned through association or reinforcement, but are often learned by watching the behavior of other people          ooThrough social learning, some behaviors are passed along from one generation to the next      ooSocial learning in Japanese macaques                  Particular species of monkeys in Japan          Group of researchers were going to study them          The researchers would toss them sweet potatoes          One day, one of the monkeys washed the sweet potato off in the ocean (none of the other monkeys knew to do that)                          Eventually all of them did it through observation                                          Social Learning of Fear  Researchers observed that lab-reared monkeys were not afraid of snakes the way monkeys in the wild are          ooThis research demonstrated that animals fears can be learned through observation      ooMonkeys in the lab hadnt seen the snakes, but also werent around other monkeys who had that fear response that they could pick up        Social forces play a role in fear-learning in humans, too          ooHearing something is dangerous                  You are less likely to do it later          If you hear that an amusement park is dangerous, you might be scared to go there                    ooSeeing another persons fear response                              Deans wife has a fear of roaches that she developed from watching her sister have extreme fear of roaches                                            Demonstration and Imitation   Modeling : the imitation of behavior through observational learning          ooModeling is effective only if the observer is physically capable of imitating the behavior                  If you only had one arm, it would be physically harder to imitate behavior                    ooWe are much more likely to imitate attractive, high-status, or similar models                  If you watch reality TV, you might think its okay to be more dramatic since those people have high status                    ooOften occurs implicitly        Imitation is much less common in nonhuman animals than in humans          ooThe Japanese monkeys are an anomaly        Bookmark added at 00:14 in Audio 1Social Learning of Behavior   Vicarious reinforcement          ooIs a models behavior reinforced or punished?         Vicarious learning          ooLearning the consequences of an action by watching others being rewarded or punished for performing the action                  Seeing someone else get a speeding ticket might make you drive safer                      A key distinction in learning is between the acquisition of a behavior and its performance  In other words, learning a behavior does not necessarily lead to performing that behavior  What happens in the brain during imitation learning?   Mirror neurons          ooNo one is certain of their exact function      ooMay serve as the basis of imitation learning      ooMay help us explain and predict others behavior      ooMay be the neural basis for empathy                  Why is someone crying?

Does violent media increase aggressive behavior?          ooTheres a lot of research that says yes        Does violent media increase violent behavior?          ooYES! YES! YES!            Violent media leads to long-term and short-term aggressive behavior (Anderson et al., 2003)        Even short periods of exposure to violent media lead to desensitization (Carnagey, Anderson, &amp;amp; Bushman, 2007)        Viewing habits at age 8 predict criminal activity and violent behavior at age 30 (Eron, 1987)    A meta-analysis of such studies suggests that, indeed, violent media increases the likelihood of aggression (Gentile, Saleem, &amp;amp; Anderson, 2007)          ooA lot of evidence that it impacts behavior        Does violent media increase violent behavior?          ooNO! NO! NO!        Competition, not violence, may have the greatest influence on aggressive behavior (Adachi &amp;amp; Willoughby, 2011)  Cooperative gameplay decreases aggressive cognitions (Schmierbach, 2010)  Cooperative gameplay also produces less physiological arousal (Carnagey, Anderson, &amp;amp; Bushman, 2007)          ooYou become less agitated when playing with others than by yourself        Gamers scored better on several measures of adjustment and risk-taking than non-gamers (Durkin &amp;amp; Barber, 2002)Chapter 7 (part 1)Thinking and intelligence  How would you define thinking          ooBookmark added at 27:20 in Audio 1        The field of psychology that focuses on thought is called cognitive psychology  Two components          ooBrain represents information      oo Thinking is the mental manipulation of these representations         Cognition includes thinking and the understandings that result from thinking  Our thoughts consist of mental representations   Analogical representations          ooMental representations of objects (caricatures, maps, etc)         Symbolic representations          ooMost frequently used symbolic representations are concepts      oo Concept                  Mental representation          Musical instruments                          Guitar                                  Has six strings                                            Violin                                  Has four strings                                            Trumpet                                  Is blown into                                                                        All of these are playedDefining attributes  In this way of thinking about concepts, a category is characterized by a list of features that determine whether an object is a member  Bachelor          ooUnmarried and male        Not always clear          ooA sixteen year old boy      ooA man in his 30s who goes on several dates each week      ooA man in a relationship of 35 years who has never married      ooAre the above bachelors?

Watson          ooArgued that only observable behavior was valid indicator of psychological activity      ooBelieved that the environment and its effects were the sole determinants of learning              ooBlank slate                    Classical conditioning  Neutral object comes to elicit a response when it is associated with a stimulus that already produces that responseTypical Pavlovian experiment involves different trials   Conditioning trials          ooTrials involving both the neutral and unconditional stimulus         Critical trials          ooNeutral stimulus is tested and the effect on the reflex is measured         Neutral and unconditioned stimuliTerminology of Pavlovs experiments   UR, US, CS, and CRImportant concepts  Pavlov believed that conditioning is the basis of adaptive behaviors          ooIncrease chances of survival         Acquisition  Critical element in the acquisition of a learned association is time, or contiguity          ooThe CR is stronger when there is a very brief delay between the CS and the US        How long do learned behaviors persist?          ooVaries         Extinction   Spontaneous recovery                  ooTime has passed. The conditioned response comes back immediately after reintroducing the CS                    Vocab            Gustation      The sense of taste                  Taste buds      Sensory organs, mostly on the tongue which are tiny and mushroom-shaped              Olfaction      The sense of smell              Olfactory epithelium      Thin layer of tissue embedded with smell receptors              Olfactory bulb      Smell receptors transmit information to this (brain center for smell)              Haptic sense      Sense of touch              Audition      Sense of sound              Sound wave      Change in air pressure that travels through the air              Loudness      Determine by sound waves amplitude              Pitch      Determined by sound waves frequency              Timbre      Describes a sounds quality              Kinesthetic sense      Perception of the bodys position in space and movement of the body and limbs              Equilibrium      Perception of balance (created by inner ear)              Conditioning      Process in which environmental stimuli and behavioral responses become connected              Classical conditioning      Learning that two types of events occur together              Operant conditioning      Learning that a behavior leads to a particular outcome              John B Watson      Argued that only observable behavior was valid indicator of psychological activity              Ivan Pavlov      Created classical conditioning theories.              Neutral stimulus      Anything the animal can see or hear as long as it is NOT associated with the reflex being tested (ex: ringing bell)              Unconditional stimulus      Stimulus that elicits a response, such as reflex, without any prior learning              Conditioning trials      Neutral stimulus is introduced in tandem with the unconditioned stimulus              Critical trials      Neutral stimulus alone is tested and the effect on the reflex is measured (ex. Ring a bell)              Unconditional response (UR)      Response that does not have to be learned (reflex, such as salivating)              Unconditional stimulus (US)      A stimulus that elicits a response, such as a reflex, without any prior learning              Conditioned stimulus (CS)      A stimulus that elicits a response only after learning has taken place              Conditioned response (CR)      A response to a conditioned stimulus; a response that has to be learned              Acquisition      Gradual formation of an association between CS and US              Extinction      Occurs when the CR is weakened because the CS is repeated without the CR              Spontaneous recovery      A previously extinguished response reemerges after the presentation of the CS      "

Become isolated easier                  Less connected                      People are living longer  The number of people over age 85 is growing dramatically          Better medicine      The elderly contribute much to modern society  Many older adults work productively well past their 70s          Supreme court  Most are over the age of 85      Morgan Freeman  Still acting      Paul Simon                  Still touring                    Deterioration  The body and mind start deteriorating slowly at about age 50          Adolescents continue growing until your 25                  Your brain stops growing after this                    50 starts going backward        Trivial physical changes include the graying and whitening of hair and the wrinkling of skin          Surface level changes        Some of the most serious changes affect the brain, where frontal lobes shrink proportionally more than other brain regions          Frontal lobes are center of higher cognitive thought      Explains why older people have trouble remembering things or keeping up with things and learning new technologies      Exacerbated in some individuals                            The brain of someone with Alzheimers has physically afflicted brain                          Where you would normally find the hippocampus, there is nothing there## Cognitive changes                                            It is difficult to pinpoint the causes of cognitive decline in old age          Perhaps if someone older stops reading, their brain loses some strength        The frontal lobes, which play an important role in working memory and many other cognitive skills, typically shrink as people grow older          People with impaired hearing wont participate in conversation because they lose the ability to engage as much                  Causes a more general decline in mental ability                      Types of changes          Slowing of mental processing speed      Sensory-perceptual changes      Sensitivity to sensory information                  Someone driving really slow might be worried because they are processing sensory information slower## Changes in Memory                      Long-term memory is less affected by aging than is working memory          Childhood stories are safe      Working memory includes someone telling you their phone number                  Usually stays in a normal brain for a minute, then its gone                    Multitasking suffers        Older people often need more time to learn new information          Once they learned, they use it as efficiently as younger people      Especially true for recognition tasks        One reason for the decline in memory related to aging is that older adults tend not to use strategies that facilitate memory          They dont have life-styles that promote learning      They have a routine often                  Eat and do the same things every day                      Another reason for declines in working memory is age-related reductions in dopamine activity in the frontal lobes          Dopamine is related to reward      Not as rewarded by environmental stimuli## Changes in Intelligence        Research has indicated consistently that intelligence, as measured on standard psychometric tests, declines with advanced age          They have a harder time with IQ tests        Fluid intelligence vs. Crystallized intelligence          Fluid intelligence refers to the ability to process new general information without specific prior knowledge                  IQ requires fluid          This is analyzing something youve never seen before and finding a solution                    Crystallized intelligence refers to specific knowledge that must be learned or memorized                  Things youve already learned                          Older people excel at this              Older people can even grow this                                            Crystallized intelligence usually increases throughout life  Although memory and the speed of processing may decline, the continued ability to learn new information may mitigate those losses in terms of daily functioning## Positive Changes in Adulthood  Except for dementia, older adults have fewer mental health problems, including depression, than younger adults          Most are pretty content      Even with chronic or daily pain, most end up happier        Socioemotional selectivity theory          As people grow older, they perceive time to be limited      As a result, they adjust their priorities to emphasize emotionally meaningful events, experiences, and goals      Older people show better memory for positive than for negative information      Vocab            Term      Definition                  Fluid
