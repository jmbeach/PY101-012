“Us vs. Them”
Think of any major conflict going on in the world

How are stereotypes maintained?
Stereotypes exaggerate differences between groups
“Otherness” is enhanced
Stereotypes underestimate differences within the stereotyped group
Outgroup 
homogeneity effect
:
 
Once 
we categorize others as ingroup or outgroup members, we tend to view outgroup members as less varied than ingroup 
members
Stereotypes 
are 
self
-maintaining 
They direct our attention toward information that confirms them and away from disconfirming evidence
Subtyping:
 When we encounter someone who does not fit a stereotype, we put that person in a special category rather than alter the 
stereotype

Estimated
AVERAGE
“Jerome’s not like other Republicans. He’s actually pretty liberal on many issues.”
Inhibiting Stereotypes
We can consciously alter our automatic stereotyping
Presenting 
positive examples of admired 
Black 
individuals (e.g., Denzel Washington) produced more-favorable responses toward African 
Americans
Training 
people to respond counter-stereotypically 
— 
having 
them press a “no” key when they saw an elderly person paired with a stereotype of the 
elderly — 
led to reduced automatic 
stereotyping
Telling 
people that their test scores indicate that they hold negative stereotypes can motivate people to correct their beliefs, and the worse they feel about holding those beliefs, the harder they try not to be 
biased
However, in 
everyday life, inhibiting stereotyped thinking is difficult and requires self-control
What reduces conflict and prejudice?
Equal 
legal 
status, economic opportunities, and power among different groups
Authorities and community institutions provide moral, legal, and economic support for both sides
Both sides must have many opportunities to work and socialize together, formally and informally
Contact hypothesis
Cooperation and working together for a common goal
